    // built on a promise the native side never kept: lib/audioEffects.ts

    // itself when media starts, so claiming it at launch would cut off

    // browse. If a device test shows playback still dying on background, an
    // explicit setActive(true) is the next thing to try — at the cost of that
    // interruption. Deliberately no .mixWithOthers either: a music player is
    // meant to take over the output, and mixing forfeits the lock-screen Now
